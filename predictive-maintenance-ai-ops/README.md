# Predictive Maintenance Using AI for IT Systems

## Project Overview
This is a demo project simulating a predictive maintenance system using AI and machine learning models to forecast system failures in IT infrastructure before they occur. The project integrates machine learning with real-time monitoring systems and automates incident management workflows.

### Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Collects historical performance and failure data from logs and monitoring tools.
- **Model Development**: Uses machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict anomalies and failures.
- **Integration**: Integrates the predictive models into a continuous monitoring pipeline (e.g., Kubernetes) for auto-scaling resources.
- **Automation**: Automatically generates incident tickets and triggers repair scripts upon failure detection.
- **Innovation**: Incorporates reinforcement learning to adapt and improve model predictions over time.

## What is Predictive Maintenance?
Predictive maintenance involves forecasting potential failures in systems before they happen by analyzing historical data and detecting anomalies or trends. This approach helps reduce downtime, optimize resource allocation, and prevent unexpected breakdowns in IT operations.

## How the System Works
1. **Data Collection**:  
   We gather system logs, performance metrics, and sensor data from IT monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Dynatrace, or Datadog. The data is used to train machine learning models for anomaly detection and prediction.

2. **Model Development**:  
   Machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and deep learning models are trained using historical data to identify patterns of failure. This model predicts system issues before they occur.

3. **Model Integration**:  
   The trained models are integrated into a continuous monitoring pipeline using Kubernetes for dynamic scaling of resources when an issue is predicted. This allows automatic scaling up or down of services based on model predictions.

4. **Automation**:  
   When the model flags an impending issue, automated scripts are triggered to:
   - Open incident tickets in platforms like ServiceNow.
   - Run repair scripts to mitigate the problem.

5. **Innovation**:  
   The system incorporates reinforcement learning to dynamically improve model predictions over time. The model adapts based on feedback from real-time system performance.
